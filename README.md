# Crud-Workers
This project is aimed to be a simple api with CRUD operations that manage a collection of Workers. However, my final goal is to make this api Restful by implementing the REST constraints.

The project is being built on Java Spring, using MySql and tested with Junit, Mockito and Postman.
## Usage
You just need to connect to the MySql database by going to the dummy configuration file inside src/main/resources called applicationDummy.properties. There you need to overwrite the DB_NAME and the MYSQL_PASSWORD with your account data.

After this, you have to run the spring project and if everything is ok you are now connected with the MySql database and ready to use the api.

Finally, you can use the api via postman after you fork the endpoint collection with the following link
